        <p>CoderCamp was born from the spirit of BarCamp, and has evolved into a monthly mini-conference. CoderCamp is for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.</p>

                <p>CoderCamp meets monthly in local pubs in Hamilton, Ontario. We are an offshoot of <a href="http://www.softwarehamilton.com/">Software Hamilton</a>, an organization dedicated to connecting Greater Hamilton's software and startup communities.</p>
                
                <p>We have a projector and screen set up for people to give presentations. We try to have a few speakers lined up in advance to give the event structure, but there is usually room for “open mic” presentations or discussions if you’re interested in sharing. We welcome you to come, talk, discuss, share, or just sit quietly and listen.</p>
                
                <p>CoderCamp is an inclusive group that welcomes students, professional developers, freelancers and entrepreneurs.</p>
