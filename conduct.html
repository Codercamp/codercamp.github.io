    <ul>
      <li>We want to be inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behavior.</li>
      <li>Don’t make exclusionary jokes. Don’t even make them "ironically".</li>
      <li>Don’t harass people. Unconsented physical contact or sexual attention is harrassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent.</li>
      <li>Aggression and elitism are unwelcome here — codercamp is not a competition.</li>
      <li>Although we meet in a pub, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol. Don’t question anyone’s choice of drink.</li>
      <li>We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise, and use what they prefer.</li>
      <li>Discussions of how to make codercamp more inclusive are welcomed.</li>
    </ul>
