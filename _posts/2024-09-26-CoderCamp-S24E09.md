CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

## Call Me, Maybe

[James King](https://agentultra.com) is presenting this month.  We're going to deep dive on the C calling conventions. Learn a little bit of assembly, stack frames, and pointers.  The computing world, for better or worse, is built on this stuff.  Whether you're interested in compilers, interoperability, or security there's a little bit here for everyone.  Expected dated, cringe pop-culture references.

## ðŸŒŽ COVID-19 safety measures

Masking is fine and encouraged. If you are experiencing symptoms we ask that you stay home, recover, and join us next time!
