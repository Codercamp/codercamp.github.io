CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

This month AJ Bovaird is going to talk about Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and how it can help alleviate the drawbacks that CRUD-based systems start to exhibit when they become larger and more sophisticated.

[James King](http://agentultra.com) ([@agentultra](http://www.twitter.com/agentultra)) talked about his new Haskel library [Data.Migration](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/DataVersion-0.1.0.0/docs/Data-Migration.html) and Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)) talked about developing in [Docker](https://www.docker.com) Containers using the new [Remote Development extension pack](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/download/extension) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
