CoderDrinks is a casual pub night meetup for software develpers, tech enthusiasts, coding hobbists, and anyone else that thinks that sounds neat that wants to engage the Hamilton software community. Come out and meet up with like minded people, make some new connections, talk shop, trade ideas, or discuss ideas on why neither Luke or C3PO have been in any of the new Star Wars trailers.
