CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

## "Living" in the container

[Chris Adkins](https://cjadkins.com) is presenting this month. We're going to talk about developing inside containers, and why you would even consider such a thing. From there we'll continue down the rabbit hole and see how this extends to CI and how the benefits of portability can help with our sanity.

are experiencing symptoms we ask that you stay home, recover, and join
us next time!
