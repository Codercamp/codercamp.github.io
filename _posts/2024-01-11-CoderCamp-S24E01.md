CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

## Breaking the Rules

[James King](https://agentultra.com) is presenting this month. We're going to learn about exploits and running our code on machines that don't want us to run our code on them... so that you can prevent such attacks in your systems. Also, learn how to homebrew your own software and breathe new life into perfectly useful devices.

## ðŸŒŽ COVID-19 safety measures

Mosaic run an air purifier and masking is fine and encouraged. If you
are experiencing symptoms we ask that you stay home, recover, and join
us next time!
