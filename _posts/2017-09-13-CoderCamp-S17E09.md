This month, we are going to do a series of lightning talks of 5 minutes on various development
topics. If you've been thinking of giving a talk, this is an excellent opportunity
to get your feet wet, so feel free to prepare a short talk and we will fit it in.

### Best Worst Practices: Optimizing for Code Size ##

I wrote a game for http://js13kgames.com. Working with extreme limitations can require "creative" solutions. I'll share some of the ways I abuse JS and various tools to get my game to fit into 13 _generous_ kilobytes.

### Data Science ###

Leo will give a talk about machine learning, or neural networks.

### Javascript Async/await ###

Rob is going to tell us a thing or two about using async/await in javascript.
