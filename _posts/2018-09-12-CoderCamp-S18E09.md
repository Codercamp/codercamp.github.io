CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

This month, Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)) will give a short talk about [Azure DevOps Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) and [James King](http://agentultra.com) ([@agentultra](http://www.twitter.com/agentultra)), the engineering manager at [Weever Apps](https://weeverapps.com/), will give a quick introduction to the programming language [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).

We are always looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
