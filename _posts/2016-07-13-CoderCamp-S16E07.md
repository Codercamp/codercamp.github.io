[John Gerryts](https://twitter.com/phonikg) from [ethembedded](https://ethembedded.com/) will share a talk titled Ethereum & the DAO: The exploit and the (non)fix.

Here is a link to discussion about the incident in the [Ethereum subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/4oiqj7/critical_update_re_dao_vulnerability/).

With one speaker we expect to end early and enjoy the patio weather.
