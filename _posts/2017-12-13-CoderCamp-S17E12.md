The Pheasant Plucker is booked for Christmas events this month, so we are moving across the street to the [Winking Judge](http://www.winkingjudge.com/) for CoderDrinks instead. Join us to talk tech and programming. We will resume our regularly scheduled talks in January.

We will grab tables. If you don't recognize anyone when you arrive, ask at the bar.
