CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

This month, [Rodney Barnes](https://github.com/rdnybrns) will be giving a lightning talk on web scraping and his app [Where Should I Vote?](https://vote.bybarnes.dev), which scrapes [elections.ca](https://elections.ca) to query for and display polling station information for a given address or postal code.

[Shalom Shore](http://shalomshore.com/) is web designer, UX architect, and entrepreneur, with a background in WordPress, Ad Tech, and Startup development. He'll be presenting a short UX case study from his work on an ad server redesign, illustrating how some creative thinking and pre-existing resources can be harnessed to make a quick and cost-effective pivot on a piece of software. You'll get introduced to wireframing tools, creative thinking methodologies, and the importance of client interviews.

We are always looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
