CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

This month, [Rodney Barnes](https://github.com/rdnybrns) will be giving a lightning talk on web scraping and his app [Where Should I Vote?](https://vote.bybarnes.dev), which scrapes [elections.ca](https://elections.ca) to query for and display polling station information for a given address or postal code.

We are always looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
