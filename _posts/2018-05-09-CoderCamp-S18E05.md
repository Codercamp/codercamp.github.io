This month is brought to you by the letter D.

[Kevin Quan](https://www.instagram.com/kquan21/) will finish up our [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) series with a talk about the [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle). Kevin is a software developer at [Population Health Research Institute (PHRI)](http://www.phri.ca/).
He is crazy about [Shiba Inus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiba_Inu) and dogs in general.

[Dave Smith-Hayes](https://davesmithhayes.com/) will give a quick talk about why soft skills are important to a software developer, or any other person in a technical field. Dave is a web developer at [Mabel's Labels](https://mabelslabels.com/) here in Hamilton, as well as a part time audio engineer, [music producer](https://soundcloud.com/dvorak), and stand up comedian.

We are always looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
