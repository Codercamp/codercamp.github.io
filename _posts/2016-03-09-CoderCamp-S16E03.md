Pieter Geerkens will share an introduction to Monads, and a way to use them in C#

Our other talk will either be about upgrading from Angular 1 to Angular 2, a hobby OS called intermezzOS or something else entirely.  We are still compiling, give us some time to get it sorted.




We're looking for more volunteers to give future presentations -- [please contact us!](mailto:codercamp@gmail.com)
