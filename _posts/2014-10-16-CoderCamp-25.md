International librarian of mystery [John Fink](https://twitter.com/adr) will tell us about Backblaze pods -- "their general history, why we bought them when offline storage is cheap, what we're doing with them now and what we'll be doing with them later."
 
Canadian [NUnit project maintainer Rob Prouse](http://www.alteridem.net) is going to walk us through the lifecycle of an open source contribution on [GitHub](https://github.com/rprouse), from the side of the contributor and the project maintainer.

It's canning season, so Open Hamilton's Anand Sinha will tell us about the Open Data Jam happening on the weekend of November 21-23.  *(ed. it's hackathon, not fruit preserves)*
