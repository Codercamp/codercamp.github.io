CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

## "Living" in the container

[Chris Adkins](https://cjadkins.com) is presenting this month. We're going to talk about developing inside containers, and why you would even consider such a thing. From there we'll continue down the rabbit hole and see how this extends to CI and how the benefits of portability can help with our sanity.

## 🌎 COVID-19 safety measures

Mosaic run an air purifier and masking is fine and encouraged. If you
are experiencing symptoms we ask that you stay home, recover, and join
us next time!
