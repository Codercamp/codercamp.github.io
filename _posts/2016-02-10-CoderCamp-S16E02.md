[AJ Bovaird](https://twitter.com/ajbovaird) will talk about cross-platform mobile development using
[Xamarin](https://xamarin.com/) and [Rob Prouse](http://www.alteridem.net/) will follow by demoing a
[Xamarin.Forms](https://xamarin.com/forms) mobile app targeting Android, iOS, Windows 10 UWP, 
Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1. 

The code for the mobile app will be available on the [CoderCamp Hamilton GitHub Organization](https://github.com/codercamp) after the talk.

We're looking for more volunteers to give future presentations -- [please contact us!](mailto:codercamp@gmail.com)
