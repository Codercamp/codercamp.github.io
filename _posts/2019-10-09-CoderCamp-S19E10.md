CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

This month's talk will be on testing Vue components by [Brian Hogg](http://brianhogg.com/). "Always wanted to automatically test your Vue.js components but not sure where to start? See some examples of how you can do just that using Jest, along with some things to watch out for."

We are always looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
