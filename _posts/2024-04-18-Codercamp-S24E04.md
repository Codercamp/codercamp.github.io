CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

## Grieving Technical Projects
Bryan Poetz will be talking about how to help teams navigate grief, fear, and uncertainty when plans change.


## ðŸŒŽ COVID-19 safety measures
