CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

[David Beckford](https://www.wavedna.com/about/) will demonstrate Chordalina and introduce the Max/MSP language used to create the software. It takes years for an individual to develop the coordination and dexterity to perform a traditional instrument. Chordalina includes people in the music making process, by allowing them to shape layers of music over time - like clay on a wheel.

We are always looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
