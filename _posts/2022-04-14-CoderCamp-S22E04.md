CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

We are kicking off CoderCamp again with informal mini-CoderDrinks üç∫ at Mosaic on Barton in Hamilton. There will be no presentations, just a get together of like-minded developers, techies, and friends. We'll return to presentations in the fall.

We are looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
