Rob Porter ([@rgeraldporter](https://twitter.com/rgeraldporter)) from
[Weaver Apps](http://weeverapps.com/) will be speaking about coding and digital
solutions to naturalist problems, touching upon improvements on collecting
species data in the field, making historical sets of Hamilton species data going
back decades more available, all using some functional
[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) & [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
code and maybe even some [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

[Rob Prouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse) and [Bryan Poetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)
 will lead a discussion about the future format of CoderCamp. Bring your ideas
 about what types of presentations you would like to see and thoughts on changes
 we can make to the format.

We are still looking for a second presentation. Please
[contact us](mailto:codercamphamilton@gmail.com) if you are interested in giving
a talk.
