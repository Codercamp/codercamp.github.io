Rob Porter ([@rgeraldporter](https://twitter.com/rgeraldporter)) from
[Weaver Apps](http://weeverapps.com/) will be speaking about coding and digital
solutions to naturalist problems, touching upon improvements on collecting
species data in the field, making historical sets of Hamilton species data going
back decades more available, all using some functional
[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) & [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
code and maybe even some [R](https://www.r-project.org/).

Nathan Jervis ([@mirhagk](https://twitter.com/mirhagk)) will talk about Visual Studio Team Services (aka Visual Studio Online, aka Team Foundation Server) and how it can be the central location for all the parts of development that aren't in your editor (source control hosting, issue management, product planning, contininous builds, releases, testing). How it can work with whatever tools you have, mixing and matching the right tools for the right job.

[Rob Prouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse) and [Bryan Poetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)
 will lead a discussion about the future format of CoderCamp. Bring your ideas
 about what types of presentations you would like to see and thoughts on changes
 we can make to the format.

Please
[contact us](mailto:codercamphamilton@gmail.com) if you are interested in giving
a talk.
