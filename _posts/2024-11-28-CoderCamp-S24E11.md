We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

## Working better with your manager

Trevor Twining is presenting this month.  We're going to cover some ways devs can work better with your product managers, using an API as a metaphoric tool to guide the conversation.

Trevor spend more than 20 years as a web developer before shifting to product in 2018. He's worked with edtech companies building brand new products and scaling existing products.
