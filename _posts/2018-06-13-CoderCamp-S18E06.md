Note the change of venue this month. If the weather is good, we will grab a table on the back patio, otherwise we will likely be upstairs. Please ask at the bar if you can't find us.

CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

Meg recently had the opportunity to develop a lot of visual, educational [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) content for [Manifold.co](https://www.manifold.co/).  The only problem?  She had zero prior experience in Container Orchestration.  In this lightning fast patio talk, she’s going to flail her hands wildly and talk about that experience: what it’s like to distill a complex system out of an engineer’s head across six time zones with some takeaways on how you can do the same.

Meg ([@megthesmith](https://twitter.com/megthesmith)) is a graphic designer at [Manifold.co](https://www.manifold.co/) and also one of the Hamilton Chapter Co-Leads of [Canada Learning Code](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/).  When she’s not doing that, you can find her making art, growing tasty things in her garden and enjoying all the best outdoor spots in Hamilton.

We are looking for future speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
