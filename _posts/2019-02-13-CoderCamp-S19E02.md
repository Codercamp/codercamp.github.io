CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

This month, Shanta R. Nathwani ([@shantadotca](https://twitter.com/shantadotca)), is the Quality Assurance Supervisor at [@WeeverApps](https://twitter.com/WeeverApps)) Her project, An Affordable REST, was designed to help people in Toronto find affordable housing, based on size of the unit and any special requirements.

The City of Toronto has over a 5 year waiting list for affordable housing. In order to determine which development that a seeker can apply to, they must speak with someone at Toronto Community Housing. What if this information was not only made available through open data, but made available on a website? Think of the benefits to those in need.
