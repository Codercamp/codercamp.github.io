CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

In light of the ongoing COVID-19 situation, this will be an online only event featuring several lightning talks! All are welcome to attend and/or give a talk.

Confirmed talks include:

* [Matt Grande](https://twitter.com/mattgrande) talking about why he thinks emoji are neat

We are always looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
