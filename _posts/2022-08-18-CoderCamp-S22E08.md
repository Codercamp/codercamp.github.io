CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

We are kicking off CoderCamp again with informal CoderDrinks üç∫ on the patio of Mosaic on Barton in Hamilton. There will be no presentations, just a get together of like-minded developers, techies, and friends. We'll return to presentations in the fall.

## üåé COVID-19 safety measures

We will meet outside on the patio, weather permitting, otherwise inside. We ask that if you are experiencing any Covid symptoms that you refrain from attending, we'll see you next time.

We are looking for speakers or lightning talks. If you would like to talk, get in touch with Bryan Poetz ([@bpoetz](https://twitter.com/bpoetz)) or Rob Prouse ([@rprouse](https://twitter.com/rprouse)).
