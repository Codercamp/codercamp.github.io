[James King](http://agentultra.com) ([@agentultra](http://www.twitter.com/agentultra)), the engineering manager at [Weever Apps](https://weeverapps.com/) will talk about Formal Specifications for the Working Stiff.

As software developers we've all worked with specifications of one form or another. The problem with most of these is that they're probably not good enough for certain kinds of difficult tasks. How do you know that a box diagram is correct? Can you execute a mockup? How do you model concurrency? The problem is that these specifications are not usually specific enough and source code is too close to the implementation to catch the overall design issues. James will introduce you to just enough of the maths behind tools that help us reason about concurrent, distributed systems and check our work for us. At the end you should know enough to start on the path of learning how to write specifications that matter.

James has a knack for making big ideas easy to digest. He has given talks at Pycon, Openstack Design Summit, and Codercamp Hamilton! We might talk about cool procedural algorithms, functional programming, interactive theorem proving for the working stiff, or why Postgres is amazing.
