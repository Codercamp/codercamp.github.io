[James King](http://agentultra.com) ([@agentultra](http://www.twitter.com/agentultra)), the engineering manager at [Weever Apps](https://weeverapps.com/) will talk about **TBD**.

James has a knack for making big ideas easy to digest. He has given talks at Pycon, Openstack Design Summit, and Codercamp Hamilton! We might talk about cool procedural algorithms, functional programming, interactive theorem proving for the working stiff, or why Postgres is amazing.
