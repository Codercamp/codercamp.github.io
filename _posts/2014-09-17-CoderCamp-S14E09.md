Ken Wong will tell us about some of the principles of animation and provide some examples of how they are being used in software today.

[AJ Bovaird](https://twitter.com/ajbovaird) will talk about why real programmers hate him (an pretty much every other .NET developer) for using an Anemic Domain Model in most of his business applications.
