CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

## Tales of two asyncs

Jenifer Champagne is a software developer and electronics tinkerer.
She will talk about lessons learned in using the `async`/`await` feature in JavaScript and Rust, along with a couple outage incidents caused by not having a deep enough understanding of how these features work under the hood.

## ðŸŒŽ COVID-19 safety measures

Mosaic run an air purifier and masking is fine and encouraged. If you
are experiencing symptoms we ask that you stay home, recover, and join
us next time!
