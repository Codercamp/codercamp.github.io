CoderCamp Hamilton is a monthly meetup / mini-conference for local software developers to learn tools, techniques, and technologies from one another in a casual and friendly setting. We meet to talk about coding, software development, and technology to learn from each other and get better at what we do in the process.

This month James King (yup, [that one](https://agentultra.com "James King's Homepage")) will give you the run down on _recursion schemes_. This is an absolute beginners talk going from first principles so don't worry if you don't know what recursion schemes are -- and if you do, don't be intimidated by them! No jargon, no fuss.
